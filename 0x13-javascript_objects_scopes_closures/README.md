### 0-rectangle.js
> An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
### 1-rectangle.js
> A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

>> - The constructor takes 2 arguments w and h,
>> - Initializes the instance attribute width with the value of w,
>> - Initializes the instance attribute height with the value of h.
### 2-rectangle.js
> A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
>> - The constructor takes 2 arguments w and h,
>> - Initializes the instance attribute width with the value of w,
>> - Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h,
>> - If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, it creates an empty object.
### 3-rectangle.js
> A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
>> - The constructor takes 2 arguments w and h,
>> - Initializes the instance attribute width with the value of w,
